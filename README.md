# Avarice Sheets
react app for managing character and campaign sheets

## IMPORTANT 

I am right in the middle of adding Redux-Saga and connecting the React App to the backend REST API. I have finished the logging in and registering functionality (pardon the design, it will be fixed), but you cannot currently view the individual sheets without causing an error.

[hello]() is a branch deploy that will give you a good idea of what the sheets are like. This is the version I was using with JSON just to get everything set up.
